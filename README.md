# Checkers AI Game

Project to create an AI for a game of Checkers using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Minimax & Heuristic Minimax.

## Technologies Used

* Java

## Summary of Project

* First I created both a 4X4 and 8X8 board on which two Human players could play a game of Checkers.
* Next I created a Random AI to play Checkers against. This AI played valid moves randomly.
* Then, I implemented the Minimax Algorithm and created an AI to make intelligent decisions.
* Lastly, I implemented more efficient Minimax Algorithms (Alpha-Beta Minimax & Heuristic Minimax) to make Intelligent decisions.

## Future Work

* Create a GUI for the game created.
* Create an AI for Chess as it uses similar, but more complicated ideas since different pieces move differently.
